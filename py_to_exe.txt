Windows defender might prevent the exe file from running.
Make sure that it is allowed from the settings, and that pyinstaller and pip both are accessible from the cmd.

It is advised to use a new folder to store the file to be converted into an exe along with its dependent files.

From command prompt, 
1. cd to directory that contains your .py file and all other necessary files needed for the program.
2. pyinstaller -F -w -i icon.ico clock.py
    Here,
    -F : all in 1 file
    -w : removes terminal window
    -i icon.ico: add custom icon to .exe, optional
    clock.py : the file to turn into an exe

If this works, the .exe is located in the dist folder inside the directory where the original file was.
