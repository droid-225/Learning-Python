scope resolution follows this order:
(LEGB)
Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built-in
i.e. the function will look for a local variable first and then the other scopes when needing to access a variable

In python, you can make a function inside another function

# if __name__ == __main__ : (This script can be imported OR run on its own)
#                            Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                            without the main block of code executing

__name__ is called "dunder name" meaning double underscore, it is a special attribute of Python
and __main__ is called "dunder main"

Check Python's package index (pypi.org) when trying to find specific packages.
